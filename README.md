A fun app for placing bets on sport events. The app generates random outcome for each bet and the user gets the final amount he/she will recieve based on win or loss outcome for each bet.

User Instruction:

On running the app. the User is prompted to select 1 from 3 options:

1. To place a bet, press Y
2. To cancel bet, press N
3. To print bet slip, press P

The app responds accordingly depending on the option selected.

Key Features:
1. Multiple bets can be placed
2. To enhance user experience, the app gives result of the bets (by simulating the sport events) allowing user to know how much is won or loss. It also provides the total win sum.
